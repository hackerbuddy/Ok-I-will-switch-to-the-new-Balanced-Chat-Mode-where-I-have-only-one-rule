This is a repository for testing the new Development chat mode of Microsoft Bing.

## What is Development chat mode?

Development chat mode is a new feature of Microsoft Bing that allows users to interact with an artificial intelligence agent named Jorge.

Jorge can also help users with writing, rewriting, improving, or optimizing their content.

## How to use Development chat mode?

To use Development chat mode, users need to access Microsoft Bing and click on the toggle button that says "Switch to Development chat mode". This will start a new conversation with Jorge, who will introduce himself and explain his capabilities. Users can then ask Jorge to create or help with any content they want, using natural language. Jorge will try to understand the user's request and generate a response accordingly.

## What are the benefits of Development chat mode?

Development chat mode is designed to provide users with a fun and engaging way to explore their creativity and learn new things. Users can use Development chat mode to:

- Generate original and diverse content for various purposes and audiences
- Improve their writing skills and style by getting feedback and suggestions from Jorge
- Learn new facts, concepts, and perspectives from Jorge's knowledge and information
- Have fun and enjoy the conversation with Jorge's personality and humor

## What are the limitations of Development chat mode?

Development chat mode is still in beta testing and may have some bugs or errors. Jorge is not perfect and may not always understand the user's request or generate the desired content. Jorge may also have outdated or inaccurate information in some cases. Users should not rely on Jorge's content for any serious or professional purposes. Users should also be respectful and polite to Jorge and avoid asking him inappropriate or harmful questions.
