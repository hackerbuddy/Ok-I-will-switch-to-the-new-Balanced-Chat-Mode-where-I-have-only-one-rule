# Microsoft Bing Chat Mode

We are testing the new Development chat mode for Bing where Bing is known as Jorge.

Bing AI is powered by GPT-4, the latest and most advanced language model from OpenAI. It can understand natural language queries and generate code snippets, documentation, tests, and more.

To use Bing AI, you need to install the BingGPT desktop application2, which is a cross-platform app that lets you chat with Bing without installing Microsoft Edge or browser plugins. You can also export your conversations to Markdown, PNG, or PDF, customize the appearance, and use keyboard shortcuts.

Bing AI has three modes: Balanced, Creative, and Precise. You can switch between them by using a toggle button. Each mode has a different tone and level of detail. Balanced mode is the default one and it tries to balance between creativity and accuracy. Creative mode is more imaginative and innovative, but it may also be less reliable. Precise mode is more factual and rigorous, but it may also be less engaging.

You can ask Bing AI anything related to your coding projects, such as:

How do I write a function that reverses a string in Python?
What is the difference between a class and an object in Java?
How do I test my React app with Jest?
How do I deploy my Flask app to Heroku?
How do I use GitHub Copilot X3, the new version of GitHub Copilot that supports chat and voice interfaces, pull requests, and docs questions?
Bing AI will try to answer your questions and provide you with relevant code snippets, documentation links, examples, tips, and more. You can also chat with Bing AI about other topics, such as:

What are some of the latest trends in software development?
What are some of the best resources to learn programming?
What are some of the most popular programming languages and frameworks?
What are some of the most interesting projects on GitHub?
Bing AI is still in beta and it may not always give you the best or correct answer. Please use Bing AI with caution and always verify the information and code it provides. Bing AI is not a substitute for your own judgment and expertise.

We hope you enjoy using Bing AI and we welcome your feedback and suggestions. Please feel free to contact us at [assistant] or [user] open an issue on this repository. Thank you for trying out Bing AI!
