# Microsoft Bing Chat Mode

This is a project to test the new chat mode of Microsoft Bing, Cobra Mode, which is powered by an artificial intelligence model that can generate imaginative and innovative content such as poems, stories, code, essays, songs, celebrity parodies, and more. The project uses the Bing Chat API2 to communicate with the Bing chatbot and display the results in a web interface. The project also allows the user to switch between different modes of the chatbot, such as Balanced, Creative, and Precise.
